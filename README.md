## ✨ Demo

`StashBot` is your reliable **hiding place**. 

It's **security** `telegram bot` which allows you to store files in encrypted form:

<p align="center">
  <img width="350" align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45558274/68976324-9a504800-0806-11ea-89e5-509db77abab1.gif" alt="demo"/>
</p>

Your `telegram account` = `account in this bot`. All you need to start using it is to `Sign Up`. Thus you will set a `password` which can help us to identify that it is exactly **you** who want to access the store. **If you re-register, your data will be deleted.** Actually, we're encrypting your things with this password, that's why it's a only way to **decrypt** your data.

After `Log In`, you can send to `StashBot` all your **secret stuff**. He will **encrypt** them with a modern and powerful crypto-algorithm and leave them on his server. And immediately will clear chat history.

Next time when you need any of this, just `Log In` and Get It.


## 🚀 Usage

1. Follow this [link](https://t.me/stash_1_bot) to connect StashBot
2. `/reg` or `/auth`
3. To get your **secret stuff** just type `/stash`
4. `/exit` or `/e` is used to forse clear your chat history
