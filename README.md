## ✨ Demo

`StashBot` is your reliable **hiding place**. 

It's `telegram bot` which allows you to store files:

Even if someone has access to your telegram account, he will not have access to the files that are stored in the bot

<p align="center">
  <img width="350" align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45558274/69492554-5cfa5300-0eb5-11ea-841a-4534b8a6b953.gif" alt="demo"/>
</p>

**Bot** will identify **you** with your `telegram account` and `secret word` which will have been created during regestration. 

**If you re-register, your data will be deleted.** Actually, on our server we're encrypting your data with this `secret word`, that's why it's a only way to get access to your data.

After `Log In`, you can send to `StashBot` all your **secret stuff**. He will **encrypt** them with a modern and powerful crypto-algorithm and leave them on his server.

Also Bot will clean chat after a few minutes of inactivity. But actually you will still have access to all your data.

Next time when you need any of this, just `Log In` and `/Stash`.
